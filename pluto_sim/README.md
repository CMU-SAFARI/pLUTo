# pLUTo - Python Simulator

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x available on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies (NumPy and pandas) using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. `cd` into the `pluto_sim` directory.
4. Run the simulator with `python pluto_sim.py`

## Expected Behaviour

After running step 4 above, a directory named `pysim` should be created under `pluto_sim`.
This directory should contain three files identical to the ones provided in the folder `pysim_reference`.
